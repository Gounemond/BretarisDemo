MegaFlow:
Have you ever wanted to simulate a wind tunnel in your game, or have leaves of snow blow through
your village flowing naturally around buildings, speeding up down alley ways or settling slowly
in the lee of an obstacle, Lava flowing down a volcano side or Waterfalls cascading over rocks,
Or a car stirring up leaves as it drives along a road in Autumn, vortices for your plane wings,
perhaps an object floating along fast moving water, tornadoes, or even simulate gravity around
objects in space, if so then MegaFlow can help.

MegaFlow is a set of systems that allow you to use Vector Fields to control the movement of
objects or particle systems in Unity. Vector fields are a 2D or 3D grids of values that describe
the direction and magnitude of velocities for that point in space. The Vector Field can be generated
by systems such as Maya Fluids, FumeFX, Krakatoa, RealFlow etc. MegaFlow can import the files
generated by those systems in the form of .FXD or .FXA files, it also has an exporter for Maya
that will export any Maya fluid simulation to the MegaFlow .FLW format. You can then import a
single frame or multiple frames into the MegaFlow system in Unity and then use that to control
the movement of particles from either the Shuriken or Legacy particle system, or control movement
of Rigid Bodies or just general objects. Don't worry though if you don't have access to any Fluid
Simulation software as MegaFlow also comes with a system that allows you to author your own Vector
Fields inside Unity using multiple splines to define flow directions and forces.

The movement of objects interacting with the Vector Fields is via a simple physics simulation
which has parameters that allow you to control the overall force the field applies and the mass
of the objects that are interacting with it, this means you can adjust the look and feel of the
flow from either a very tight following of the flow to a subtle influencing only of objects that
move through the field. You can change the force the field exerts or reverse the flow direction.
All the values can be adjusted at runtime via script of the Unity animation system if required.
The physics code used is optimized for performance and makes use of multi threading on any system
that has multiple cores for super fast performance even with 10's of thousands of particles being
moved.

If a system such as FumeFX or Maya fluids has been used to create the Vector Fields then that would
allow you to place obstacles into the flow, if the flow is then used to control a Particle system you
can get even more performance back by disabling the collision system in the Particle system, since
the Vector Field will now handle moving the particles around objects in the way, this can get you
quite a saving in CPU time in complex scenes. You can off course still use the collision system of
the particles or rigid bodies alongside the flow system if you wish.

The Vector Field source can have any number of Vector Fields loaded so you can do animation of flows
if required, or just easily swap the flow field being used to change the look and flow of your scene.
You can ask the system to show you the flow through the system of objects via the visualization options,
or display the flow as either vector lines or colored cells.

Included in MegaFlow are various components to help you use the Vector Fields in your projects.
There are components to control the Unity particle systems as well as a component you can attach
to any rigid body object that will then allow that object to be influenced by the Vector Field.
There is also an example Smoke Gun script that will inject large numbers of objects into a scene
so you can see how they flow.

v1.18
Fixed MegaShapeLightMapWindow problem when doing an app build.
You can now build lightmap data for MegaShape standard meshes.

Fixed exception if trying to build a mesh with a shape with no splines.
Fixed exception if trying to interpolate along a shape with no splines.
Fixed exception if trying to interpolate a spline with no knots.
Autocurve fixed so the last knots handles on an open spline are correct.
Fixed some potential errors in the constant speed interpolation.
Smooth value is now a slider and shows results in realtime for easier use.

v1.17
Added a StartVal to the Create flow inspector which will be used to initialize the flow grid so you can easily set a start flow state.

v1.16

Flow Effect now has color gradient option to change the color of the object depending on the speed range set.
